## 📌 Team Ritual & Governance Policy

> ### ⚠️ MANDATORY WORKFLOW RITUAL FOR ALL TEAM MEMBERS & AI AGENTS
> Every developer (human or AI pair programmer) working on this repository **MUST** follow this ritual without exception:
>
> 1. **Trigger**: Whenever a version bump is performed in `package.json` (or `android/app/build.gradle`).
> 2. **Logging Destination**: Prepend the new release entry immediately below the `---` divider in this file (`docs/APP_JOURNEY_LOG.md`).
> 3. **Required Entry Fields**:
>    - **Version Tag**: `## [vX.Y.Z] - DD MMMM YYYY, HH:MM AM/PM IST`
>    - **Executive Summary**: A concise 1-2 sentence overview of the release purpose.
>    - **Work Breakdown**: Grouped under `### ✨ Features Added`, `### 🐛 Bug Fixes`, `### ⚡ Performance & Refactoring`, or `### 🔒 Security & Architecture`.
>    - **Impacted Scope**: Mention core modules or paths modified (e.g., `src/features/quiz/`, `src/lib/navigation/`).
> 4. **STRICT ZERO-SENSITIVITY POLICY**:
>    - **NEVER** log API keys, access tokens, secrets, service passwords, internal database URLs, or real user identifiers.
>    - Keep all descriptions high-level, architectural, and educational for developers.
> 5. **Cross-Platform Awareness**:
>    - MindFlow is both a PWA on GitHub Pages (`<HashRouter>`) and an Android app via Capacitor. Keep logs mindful of both targets.

## 🚀 App Journey Changelog

## [v1.0.286] - 31 October 2026, 04:48 PM IST

### Executive Summary
Unified the Dashboard Greeting and Action Cards into a single compact Hero Strip (Option B) and reduced inter-section vertical gaps globally (Option D), reclaiming ~80px of dead viewport space and elevating core quiz action entry points above the fold.

### ✨ UI/UX Modernization & Whitespace Optimization
- **Unified Hero Strip (`src/features/dashboard/components/DashboardGreeting.tsx`)**:
  - Integrated user greeting (`Good Afternoon, Aspirant 👋`) and the 4 action buttons (Today's Plan, Bookmarks, Resume Quiz, Quiz History) into a single translucent card container with backdrop blur and subtle border accent.
  - Streamlined action button layout with compact icons, tighter text margins, and micro-interaction active press states (`active:scale-95`).
- **Global Dashboard Spacing Consolidation (`src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`)**:
  - Reduced outer container top padding (`-mt-4 pt-4` -> `-mt-4 pt-2`) and inner content offset (`pt-3 sm:pt-5` -> `pt-1 sm:pt-2`).
  - Tightened vertical rhythm across all dashboard sections (`space-y-4` -> `space-y-2.5`), ensuring Quick Actions (Mock Test, Custom Quiz) remain readily visible on mobile viewports without excessive scrolling.

## [v1.0.285] - 31 October 2026, 04:18 PM IST

### Executive Summary
Resolved recurring background sync red alert popups ("Background sync failed. Retrying automatically...") by strictly scoping the 15-second heartbeat reconciliation timer, route transitions, and auto-retry rules to active quiz sessions.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Resilience
- **Quiz Periodic Sync Heartbeat Scoping (`src/features/quiz/hooks/useQuiz.ts`)**:
  - Restructured the 15-second periodic reconciliation timer, `beforeunload`, and `visibilitychange` window event listeners to only fire when actively inside an unpaused quiz route (`window.location.hash.includes('/quiz/session/') && currentState.status === 'quiz' && !currentState.isPaused && currentState.quizId`).
  - Stopped periodic sync cycles from executing when users pause quizzes or navigate back to the Dashboard or other routes.
- **Sync Queue & Error Toast Hardening (`src/features/quiz/stores/useQuizSessionStore.ts`)**:
  - Guarded `enqueueCloudSync('periodic_reconciliation')` to automatically no-op if called outside active quiz session routes or during paused states.
  - Eliminated repetitive `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['latest-paused-quiz'] })` calls during routine 15s heartbeats, preventing continuous background Supabase queries.
  - Suppressed alarmist red error toast notifications for non-critical background periodic sync sweeps while preserving notifications for explicit user pause/complete actions.
  - Updated `goHome()` to explicitly clear `quizId: undefined` so navigation to the Dashboard terminates lingering quiz references.
- **Idempotent Retry Policy (`src/lib/fetchWithTimeout.ts`)**:
  - Updated `isSafeToRetry` to allow safe, exponential backoff retries for idempotent `PATCH` calls to `/rest/v1/saved_quizzes`, gracefully recovering from transient network drops or token refreshes without throwing error toasts.

## [v1.0.284] - 31 October 2026, 03:56 PM IST

### Executive Summary
Fixed critical database type mismatch error (`invalid input syntax for type uuid: "HIS14"`) affecting the Bookmarks view and state synchronization when handling questions with legacy alphanumeric identifiers.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & System Hardening
- **Question Hydration by ID (`src/features/quiz/services/questionService.ts`)**:
  - Implemented smart ID partitioning via `UUID_REGEX` to isolate standard UUIDs from legacy alphanumeric identifiers (such as `"HIS14"`, `"BIO1"`).
  - Queried Supabase `questions` table using `.in('id', ...)` for UUIDs and `.in('v1_id', ...)` for legacy IDs, eliminating Postgres type casting errors (Postgres error `22P02`).
  - Wrapped batch queries in safe async executors to prevent unhandled promise rejections.
- **Bookmarks Page Resilience (`src/pages/BookmarksPage.tsx`)**:
  - Enhanced `useQuery` query function with error logging and graceful fallback.
  - Upgraded bookmark removal to delete both `question.id` (UUID) and `question.v1_id` from local IndexedDB and Supabase backend.
  - Enhanced "Reset Bookmarks" action to cleanly wipe bookmarks from both local IndexedDB and remote `user_bookmarks` table.
- **Background Sync Service (`src/lib/syncService.ts` & `src/features/quiz/stores/useBookmarkStore.ts`)**:
  - Updated `removeBookmark` API to accept and purge both `questionId` and optional `v1Id`.
  - Upgraded remote bookmark hydration to track both `id` and `v1_id`, preventing duplicate hydrations and redundant push events.
  - Hardened store bookmark toggle logic to check and filter both standard UUIDs and legacy IDs.

  - Enabled immediate optimistic UI updates for bookmarks and quiz states with resilient background synchronization to IndexedDB and cloud.
- **Provider Refactoring (`src/providers/AppProvider.tsx`, `src/lib/queryClient.ts`)**:
  - Extracted TanStack QueryClient into a clean dedicated module (`queryClient.ts`), reducing unnecessary render cycles in the core app tree.
